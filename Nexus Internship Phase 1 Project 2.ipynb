    "## Conversation Context Management:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Objective: \n",
    "\n",
    "To track the conversation history with each user, enabling the chatbot to provide context-aware responses.\n",
    "Implementation: A dictionary conversation_context is used, where each user is identified by a unique user_id. The dictionary stores a list of tuples for each user, with each tuple containing the user input and the bot's response. This allows the chatbot to recall previous interactions and provide personalized responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Personalized Responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: To deliver responses tailored to the userâ€™s previous questions and the ongoing conversation.\n",
    "Implementation: The function personalized_responses() checks the conversation history for a specific user. If a user has previously asked about deadlines and later asks about admission requirements, the bot will combine this information to provide a more comprehensive response.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Modular Function Design:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: To organize the chatbot's functionality into separate, reusable components for clarity and ease of maintenance.\n",
    "Implementation: The chatbot is structured into modular functions:\n",
    "remember_interaction(): Logs user inputs and bot responses.\n",
    "recall_interaction(): Retrieves past interactions for a specific user.\n",
    "greet_user() and farewell_message(): Provide standard greeting and farewell messages.\n",
    "get_admission_procedures(), get_admission_requirements(), get_admission_deadline(): Handle specific admission-related queries.\n",
    "respond_to_admission_queries(): Processes user queries to provide appropriate admission information.\n",
    "handle_unknown_queries(): Manages queries that the bot cannot understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. User Interaction Flow:\n",
    "\n",
    "Objective: To ensure a smooth and user-friendly interaction experience.\n",
    "Implementation: The chatbot starts by greeting the user and asking for a user_id. It then enters a loop where it processes user inputs, provides responses, and logs the conversation history. If the user decides to exit, the chatbot provides a farewell message."
